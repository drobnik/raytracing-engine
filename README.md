# Raytracing engine
A simple renderer which uses [ray tracing](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/xroads-RT/RTarticle.html) technique for generating images of 3D objects. This is still **work in progress**.

### Main features

  + Basic world primitives and `Mesh` representation
  + Basic shading system using `Phong` reflection model
  + Simple picture adaptive antialiasing
  + OBJ file parsing
  + File Manager for loading scene assets and saving rendered images


### Acknowledgements
This project is built around the ideas presented in [Ray Tracing from the Ground Up](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/) book.
